# Elmish Testing Library

A library for testing [Elmish](https://github.com/collegevine/purescript-elmish)
components on live DOM. Can be run in the browser on native DOM or under Node,
in which case it will emulate the DOM via the [Happy DOM
library](https://github.com/capricorn86/happy-dom). A different DOM emulator can
also be used as long as it's initialized before the first call to Elmish Testing
Library.

See documentation [on Pursuit](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-elmish-testing-library).
